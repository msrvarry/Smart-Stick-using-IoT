# Smart Blind Stick

## Overview

The Smart Blind Stick project aims to create an innovative solution using IoT and Arduino hardware to assist visually impaired individuals in navigating their surroundings with increased safety and autonomy.

## Features

- **Ultrasonic Sensor Integration**: Utilizes ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in the user's path.
- **Buzzer and LED Indicators**: Provides audible and visual alerts upon activation and obstacle detection.
- **Arduino-based Hardware**: Implements Arduino as the core hardware for seamless functionality.

## Project Components

- **Arduino Code**: Includes the codebase responsible for sensor data interpretation, alert generation, and overall device functionality.
- **Circuit Diagram**: Provides a schematic illustrating the connections between components.

## Usage

1. **Hardware Setup**: Assemble the components as per the circuit diagram provided.
2. **Upload Arduino Code**: Upload the code to the Arduino board using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Activation**: Power on the device and listen for the initial beep indicating activation.
4. **Obstacle Detection**: When an obstacle is detected, the buzzer emits a prolonged beep, and the LED indicator lights up.
